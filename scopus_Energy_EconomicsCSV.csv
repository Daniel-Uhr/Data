Using structural vector autoregressions (SVARs), we identify the news shocks captured in energy stock market indexes. Our findings show that renewable and fossil energy news shocks significantly affect economic activity, revealing the tensions between the traditional fossil fuel-based industries and the emerging green technology-based ones. We further identify news shocks on Economic Policy Uncertainty (EPU) index, as policy is a key factor driving the changes in the energy mix. First, we show that the identified anticipated shocks have very different propagation mechanisms from traditional surprise shocks. Then, we find that the combination of news shocks to energy stock prices and economic policy uncertainty jointly account for about 90% of the variability of output, job openings and house prices. To interpret our findings, we use a DSGE model that incorporates fossil and renewable energy sectors, and news shocks as a driving force. We show that the propagation mechanisms of news shocks in the model are consistent with our empirical observations. Our study illustrates on the critical interaction between energy news and economic policy uncertainty in affecting the real economy in the transition from dirty to clean energy technologies. © 2024 The Author(s)","Economic policy uncertainty; Expectations; News shocks; Renewable energy","United States; Costs; Economic and social effects; Energy policy; Financial markets; Regression analysis; Economic policies; Economic policy uncertainty; Energy; Expectation; Fossil energy; Fuel use; News shock; Propagation mechanism; Renewable energies; Uncertainty; alternative energy; economic activity; economic policy; fossil fuel; stock market; Fossil fuels","L.

This is the first quantitative study to examine the impacts of banding based on time series data from March 2003 to December 2018 in the UK, focusing on onshore wind, offshore wind, and solar. This study considers the impacts of banding via its feed-through effect on the markups and then investors' decisions on renewable projects, instead of considering it as an independent policy intervention. The counterfactual analysis shows that, if banding was not introduced, the offshore wind would remain silent for extended periods, then the UK might have difficulty in achieving its target for renewable generation. Besides, the costs of the RO scheme would be less, but additional fuel costs would be added to cover the generation gap. © 2024 The Author(s)","Banding; Counterfactually analysis; Renewables obligation; Solar generation; Tradable green certificates; Wind generation","Binary alloys; Offshore oil well production; Banding; Counterfactually analyse; Offshore winds; Renewable sources; Renewables Obligation; Solar generation; Technology neutrals; Tradable green certificates; United kingdom; Wind generation; Solar power generation","J.

The results indicate that fiscal balances actually increase in the medium-term following an inflationary oil shock, and public debt-to-GDP ratios fall.

Meanwhile, with the increasing awareness of environmental protection, environmental policies have been introduced to restrict firm investment choices. However, the role of environmental policy has received less attention in the previous research on energy prices and firm investment. Therefore, this paper develops a dynamic firm investment model that incorporates energy price uncertainty and environmental regulation and makes the following predictions. First, ceteris paribus, energy price uncertainty negatively impacts firm investment. Second, environmental regulations mitigate this negative impact of energy price uncertainty. Third, the mitigating effect of environmental policy is greater in pollution-intensive industries. This paper merges the micro-data on A-share listed firms in China between 2004 and 2018 with the macro-data on energy prices and environmental regulation. The empirical results align with the theoretical predictions. The robustness tests, including instrumental variables, alternative measurements, and estimation methods, validate the baseline findings.

To promote the dispersion of information consumption, China constructed an information consumption demonstration city (ICDC) in 2015; however, the impact of ICDC policies on green city development remains unclear. Thus, this study aimed to explore the impact of ICDC policies on city-level carbon dioxide and pollutant emissions. Based on panel data of 204 cities in China from 2010 to 2019, a quasi-experiment method was adopted to evaluate the effects of the ICDC policy on CO2 and SO2 emissions using a difference-in-differences model. The results indicated a significant effect of ICDC policies on green development, reducing urban CO2 and SO2 growth rates by 36% and 31%, respectively. This conclusion was validated using several robustness tests. The mechanism analysis revealed that ICDC policies increased government spending on science and technology, reduced passenger traffic volumes, and promoted the city's digital finance development but had a negative impact on innovative research and development.

Annual data of firm cross-listing over the last two decades with crisis (2002-2022) is employed for our analyses. We find evidence of significant drop in productivity after Energy firms (including electricity firms) cross-list in the US market. Meanwhile, we do not find strong evidence of significant decreases in firm productivity from other sectors in our sample. We note one possible explanation for this finding is that after cross-listing, Energy firms appear to utilize their increased capital to heavily invest in infrastructure, equipment, and plants for expansion, which might eventually damage their productivity. To seek for more thorough explanations for such decreases in Energy firms' productivity after cross-listing, we identify the determinants of firm productivity in Energy sector. Our results provide strong evidence that the increases in capital expenditures after Energy firms cross-list appear to be associated with the decreases in firm productivity. Notably, we note that negative impacts of capital expenditures (after cross-listing) and state ownership on firm productivity become much stronger and more statistically significant in developed countries than in emerging countries.

It uses the extreme environmental event of the PM2.5 surge at the end of 2011, which led to an upsurge in energy related public environmental concerns in China, as a quasi-natural experiment. According to our findings, energy related public environmental concerns lead to a significant increase in the executive–employee pay gap of polluting companies compared to that of non-polluting companies, owing to a significant increase in executive compensation and no significant change in employee income. The effect of energy related public environmental concerns on increasing the pay gap within polluting companies is more significant in samples with high agency costs, poor information transparency, less analyst follow-up, and fewer institutional investors' shareholding. Furthermore, as energy related public environmental concerns exacerbate the polluting firms' internal pay gap, their total factor productivity and investment efficiency fall significantly. In summary, energy related public environmental concerns not only widen the wage gap within polluting enterprises but also worsen their operational and investment efficiency, which has important policy implications for emerging market economies seeking to balance environmental protection and economic development. © 2024 The Authors","Emerging economies; Intra-firm pay gap; PM2.5 surge; Polluting enterprises; Public environmental concerns","China; Environmental protection; Personnel; Public policy; Emerging economies; Employee pay; Energy; Environmental concerns; Intra-firm pay gap; Investment efficiency; Natural experiment; Pm2.5 surge; Polluting enterprise; Public environmental concern; economic development; environmental economics; environmental protection; industrial emission; investment; particulate matter; total factor productivity; wage gap; Investments","Y.

We robustly find that the higher the number of natural disasters in an energy company's region, the lower the corporate tax burden. The mechanism analysis suggests that the government, motivated by concerns that energy companies are in business distress and facing financing difficulties, is the mechanism by which natural disasters lead to lower energy corporate tax burdens. In addition, the above effects are more pronounced among energy companies that are larger, have a higher market share, and are subject to stronger government intervention.
